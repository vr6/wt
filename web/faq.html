<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><div class="faq">What's this?</div>
<p>This is a mongodb log file visualization tool to help mongodb users and admins. It provides full visibility into several aspects of the query performance, such as most impacting queries etc. 

<p><div class="faq">How do you do it?</div>
<p>When selected for processing, a log file is parsed within the browser to extract minimal meta info that is needed for profiling the queries (query time etc). This meta info is sent over for further processing and for creating the summary reports.

<p><div class="faq">Can I erase the meta info for my log files?</div>
<p>The meta info is erased as soon a browser session ends for the user. Export of reports is inthe feature pipeline. 

<p><div class="faq">Is my logs meta data secure and safe?</div>
<p>Well, we don't recieve or store any real data. All that reaches us is meta info without the real data in it, which is gone once the user session ends. Also, the site uses TLS (SSL/HTTPS) for all communications. 

<p><div class="faq">What kinds of reports are we talking about?</div>
<p>You get the minimal info that you need to understand what's going on with your data queries. For example, a report about all the most impacting queries and their hourly activity, for every single hour for any day. All this in a single page.

<p><div class="faq">How do I get started?</div>
<p>Signup by using an email address and a password. Email address can be a fake one if you prefer, but a real one helps to reset, in case you forget password. .

<p><div class="faq">How does it compare with the other monitoring tools?</div>
<p>Most other monitoring tools maintain various counters such as op counters etc, and provide line charts that show the counter value aganst time. In our view, this hardly scratches the surface in providing visibility into query stats and query patterns, which are vital in triaging query related issues.

<p>Also, this solution doesn't require continuous running of any software or shell scripts. It doesn't even require access to your database, while providing an in-depth analysis of query performnce, purely based on log files.

<p><div class="faq">Is this a free service?</div>
<p>Yes.

<p><div class="faq">Any limitation on the log file size?</div>
<p>We have tested and saw it working fine for log file sizes upto 150MB.
