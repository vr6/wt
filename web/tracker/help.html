    <h3>Helping Ourselves</h3>
    <p>Data on this page is made possible through the valuable contributions from several cool folks who are helping in fetching data from USCIS by running a script to pull status for the cases. This data is stitched together and visualized on the front page.

    <p>Some great folks made their mark in data updates. The 2017 updates were ruled by a girl band lead by <b>math</b> (mathangi) with 15k updates and <b>sneha</b> with 7k updates. Currently 2018 updates are being lead by <b>tauseef</b> and several others with their relentless contribution. I can't thank these folks enough!! Kudos to you all! 

    <p><b>Adding new volunteers for data updates is currently on hold. Will let you know through comments (and on this page) when the registration opens up again. Thanks for the interest! Please keep checking this page for updates.</b>

    <p><font color="#aaaaaa">If you are interested in maintaining data for any series (one or more) please drop an email to worktheme.dev@gmail.com. You will get a token and a script that is needed for you to update the data on this site. All that you will need to do is running a script for a few minutes once a day. You can read the script to understand what it is doing.

    <p>Thank you!!
