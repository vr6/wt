PRIVACY

Account Information. When you create an Account, we will collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as email address ('Personally-Identifiable Information").

User Data. In order to perform our Services, we may also collect from you data that you have sent to us ('User Data") via electronic means to Internet addresses that we provide to you. Such User Data may include records of operations of your applications and systems and other information relating to your actions. Worktheme will never share your User Data with other Users or with any other third party. However, Worktheme reserves the right to analyze User Data in order to provide its Services to you and improve its Services.

Cookies. We collect certain information through the use of 'cookies," which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you have logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services.

Use of Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a User uses our Services (we refer to this information as 'Log Data"). Log Data may include information such as a User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and preferences. We may use a person's IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.

User Support. If you are a User with an Account, Worktheme may occasionally send you an e-mail to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what is going on with Worktheme and our products.

Worktheme takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personally-Identifying Information.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Worktheme cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Worktheme or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

Publicity. We may use your Personally-Identifiable Information for the purpose of solely identifying you as a Worktheme customer on Worktheme websites, client lists, press releases and/or other marketing documents. We may also use your Personally-Identifiable information for the purposes of publishing a brief description highlighting your use of our Services.

Security
We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personally-Identifiable Information. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personally-Identifiable Information despite our efforts. You should note that in using our Services, your information will travel through third party infrastructures which are not under our control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally-Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. While we do not require Users to send their User Data to us via encrypted transit, we encourage all Users to do so.

We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other users of the Site. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users.

Modification
If you, as a User, would like to update, correct or delete the Personally-Identifying Information in your registration profile, you may do so by contacting us at worktheme.team@gmail.com. If you request a deletion of such information, your Account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We have the right to retain an archived copy of your Personally-Identifying Information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Worktheme may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Worktheme's sole discretion. Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. Worktheme encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services after we have notified you of any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, as represented by your continued use of the Site and/or Services, followed by your submission of any Personally-Identifying Information represents your agreement to that transfer.
