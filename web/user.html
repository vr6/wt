<p>More info will be added and a few fields will be editable as we go forward.
<p><b>What is ID?&nbsp;</b>The ID is a system-generated key that uniquely identifies you as a user. You rarely need to be aware of the ID or use it explicitely. The ID is specific to the browser and the device/system that you are using. In case you want the same user context to be used on a different browser or device, then you need to copy and paste this ID into the target device.

<p><b>What is API Token?&nbsp;</b>We have some cool folks among our users who actively help by fetching the data useed by some pages of this site. The API Token is used by them for posting data to this site.
